	<para>Now your Cloud.com Management Server is running. The next step is to tell it about the hosts, storage, and network configuration that you have done in the previous sections. Launch a web browser and visit http://<replaceable>management-server-ip-address</replaceable>:8080/client</para>
	<para>The default credentials are “admin” for user and “password” for password.  The domain field should be left blank.  A blank domain field defaults to the ROOT domain.</para>

					this range. These two values combine to give the system control over a certain IP 
					address range, and leave you in control of allocation for IP addresses in the CIDR 
					but outside of the start and end range.
